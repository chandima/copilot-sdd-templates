## About SDD

This repository helps teams adopt **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**â€”a lightweight, spec-first practice where you write clear specifications before code, enabling an **intent â†’ spec â†’ autocode** loop that works seamlessly with AI agents and automation.

**Why SDD matters:**
- Clarity and alignment across teams
- Safe, repeatable AI automation
- Better traceability from requirements to implementation

**Need the full story?** See the complete [SDD Overview](docs/sdd-overview.md) for principles, benefits, the evolution continuum, and how SDD fits with other practices.

## What this repo contains

- Multiple project templates under `templates/`
- A `common/` directory with shared assets that get injected into each template during generation:
  - `common/.github/{instructions,prompts,chatmodes}`
  - `common/.vscode/*`
- A root `copier.yml` that selects a template subdirectory and propagates common assets (README.md files in `common/` are excluded from copy)

## Available templates

- `templates/beastmode` â€” agent-focused scaffold with Beast Mode chatmodes and VS Code settings
- `templates/gha` â€” GitHub Actions workflows and shared CI scaffolding
- `templates/gist` â€” lightweight scaffold (docs/snippets oriented)
- `templates/plan` â€” planning and architecture scaffold for specs, roadmaps, and reviews
- `templates/prompt` â€” prompt-engineering oriented scaffold and Copilot chat assets
- `templates/sst` â€” Serverless Stack (SST) development scaffold
- `templates/typescript` â€” general TypeScript project scaffold

### Create a new template (maintainer utility)

To scaffold a new template directory (including the current shared chatmodes) run from the repo root:

```zsh
copier copy --trust internal/new-template .
```

Answer the prompts (`template_name`, `template_slug`, and a derived `final_slug` preview). A new directory will appear at `templates/<final_slug>/` with:

- `.github/chatmodes/` populated from `common/.github/chatmodes/` (snapshot at creation time)
- Empty `.github/instructions`, `.github/prompts`, and `.vscode/mcp` folders ready for overrides

Add any additional scaffold files you want this template to provide (package manifests, config, etc.). When end users run the **root** template, shared assets from `common/` will still be injected on top of what the new template supplies.

If you later update shared chatmodes and want the new templateâ€™s snapshot refreshed, re-run the scaffold (it will not overwrite existing files unless you remove them first) or manually copy changes (the scaffold copies, it does not symlink).

Note: `--trust` is required because the internal scaffold uses Copier tasks to create folders and copy chatmode files; without it, tasks are blocked.

> Tip: Each template may include its own `.github` and `.vscode` folders to override or extend the common assets.

### Update existing templates with latest common assets (maintainer utilities)

When you change shared assets under `common/` (chatmodes, instructions, prompts, or any files under `.vscode/`) you can refresh the snapshot inside one or all template directories using internal Copier utilities (no standalone script required).

Update a single template:

```zsh
copier copy --trust internal/update-template .
```

Prompts:

- `target_template` (e.g. `gist`, `sst`, `typescript`)
- Toggle asset groups: chatmodes, instructions, prompts, mcp
- Overwrite mode: `overwrite` (default) vs `skip`

Behavior:

- Uses `rsync` to merge common assets into template directories.
- Excludes `README.md` files from common (same as root generation behavior).

These utilities keep template directories in sync for inspection or cloning; end users always receive the latest shared assets at generation via the root `copier.yml`.

## Prerequisites

- Homebrew (macOS)
- Copier (via Homebrew)

```zsh
# Install Homebrew if you need it: https://brew.sh
brew update
brew install copier
```

## Apply to an existing project with Copier

> Start here if you want to integrate these assets into an existing repo. The commands below are copyâ€‘paste ready for macOS zsh.

This repository is meant to be applied to an existing project (not to start a new one). Run Copier from your existing project root and use `.` as the destination.

### Preview (dry run)

```zsh
# From your existing project root
copier copy --pretend "gh:chandima/copilot-sdd-templates" .
```
What happens:
- If you have NOT applied this template before (no `.copier-answers.yml` yet), Copier will prompt you for `template_name`.
- If a previous run stored an answer, it will reuse it silently (so you might NOT see a prompt).

Available template names (directory names under `templates/`):
- beastmode
- gha
- gist
- plan
- prompting
- sst
- typescript

Non-interactive (explicit template, reproducible & CIâ€‘friendly):

```zsh
copier copy --pretend --data template_name=sst "gh:chandima/copilot-sdd-templates" .
```

Need to force a new prompt? Delete or edit `.copier-answers.yml` first, then rerun the dry run without `--data`.

### Apply changes

Run non-interactively by specifying the template explicitly (recommended for reproducibility):

```zsh
copier copy --data template_name=sst "gh:chandima/copilot-sdd-templates" .
```

If you omit `--data template_name=...` and no existing `.copier-answers.yml` contains a value, Copier will prompt you for `template_name`.

What happens:

- Copier writes a `.copier-answers.yml` in your project to record choices.
- Common assets and the chosen templateâ€™s files are merged into your repo.
- Existing files are respected per template rules (e.g., `skip_if_exists`), and common `README.md` files are not copied.
- Commit your repo before applying, then review the diff after.

## How common assets are applied

- During generation, common assets from `common/.github/*` and `common/.vscode/*` are copied into the output project.
- `README.md` files inside `common/` are intentionally NOT copied (to avoid overwriting your project README).
- Template-specific files take precedence if they define the same paths.

Tip: After the first apply, you can bring in updates later using `copier update` from your project root.

## Updating shared content

- Edit files under `common/.github/*` or `common/.vscode/*`.
- From your project root, run `copier update` to pull in changes while respecting your local edits.
- Because template-specific files can override common files, review diffs when updating.

Advanced:

- If you need to re-apply the template ignoring project history (not usually recommended), use `copier recopy` and resolve any conflicts, then commit.

## Troubleshooting

- If Copier doesn't prompt for `template_name`, ensure you're pointing at this repo (the template source) and running from your project root with `.` as destination.
- If your Copier version doesn't support certain features, upgrade:

```zsh
brew upgrade copier
```

- If common assets don't appear, check the root `copier.yml` in this repo and your Copier version, then re-run the apply or update.

## Notes

- Commands above are written for macOS zsh.
- MCP-related configurations live under `.vscode/mcp` (alongside any other shared VS Code settings) and `.github/chatmodes`/`prompts`/`instructions`.
