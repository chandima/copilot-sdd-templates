# Copilot Spec-driven Development (SDD) Templates

Templates for injecting shared .github and .vscode assets into an existing project, designed to work with Copier and MCP-powered workflows.

## What is Spec‑Driven Development (SDD)?

Spec‑Driven Development is a lightweight, “spec‑first” practice: write a clear, structured specification before you write code, and let that spec drive planning, design, implementation, review, and validation. In AI‑native teams this becomes an **intent → spec → autocode** loop: humans define the spec, agents plan/execute, and results feed back into the spec. The spec is the single source of truth for the team and for tools.

### Why now (AI‑native)

- **English is the new substrate** for orchestration, but it’s fuzzy — SDD adds constraints, guardrails, and interfaces so agents behave predictably.
- **Treat specs/prompts like code**: version them, observe runs, and attach evals/tests so delegation stays safe and repeatable.

### Why teams use SDD

- **Clarity and alignment** — fewer ambiguities and faster decisions
- **Traceability** — requirements map cleanly to designs, tasks, and tests
- **Smoother reviews** — concrete artifacts make PRs and change discussions easier
- **Faster onboarding and repeatability** — specs capture context so work scales
- **Safer AI automation** — AI agents can execute against explicit intent, not vibes

### How it fits with other practices

- **Complements TDD/BDD** — SDD clarifies what to build; TDD/BDD verify behavior and correctness
- **Works with iterative delivery** — specs evolve; changes are reflected in design and tasks, keeping the loop tight
- **Agent‑compatible** — specs + evals + guardrails enable reliable delegation to coding/orchestration agents

## From vibe to Smart Coding (Harald Kirchner’s continuum)

Teams evolve along a continuum:

[![The Vibe‑Coding Journey: YOLO → Structured → Spec‑Driven (slide)](media/vibe_coding_continuum.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DlNVROQ6DI)

- **YOLO Vibes** — “fun chaos”
  - Speed, instant gratification, fast learning
- **Structured Vibes** — balance & sustainability
  - Maintainability, readability, quality control
- **Spec‑Driven Vibes** — “professional zen” and engineering excellence
  - Scale, reliability, team velocity

This repo helps you move rightward on that continuum by injecting opinionated `.github` and `.vscode` assets plus chatmodes and MCP configs that encourage writing specs, reviewing changes, and automating routine steps.

## What this repo contains

- Multiple project templates under `templates/`
- A `common/` directory with shared assets that get injected into each template during generation:
  - `common/.github/{instructions,prompts,chatmodes}`
  - `common/.vscode/*`
- A root `copier.yml` that selects a template subdirectory and propagates common assets (README.md files in `common/` are excluded from copy)

## Available templates

- `templates/gist` — lightweight scaffold (docs/snippets oriented)
- `templates/sst` — Serverless Stack (SST) development scaffold
- `templates/typescript` — General TypeScript project scaffold

### Create a new template (maintainer utility)

To scaffold a new template directory (including the current shared chatmodes) run from the repo root:

```zsh
copier copy --trust internal/new-template .
```

Answer the prompts (`template_name`, `template_slug`, and a derived `final_slug` preview). A new directory will appear at `templates/<final_slug>/` with:

- `.github/chatmodes/` populated from `common/.github/chatmodes/` (snapshot at creation time)
- Empty `.github/instructions`, `.github/prompts`, and `.vscode/mcp` folders ready for overrides
- A starter `README.md`

Add any additional scaffold files you want this template to provide (package manifests, config, etc.). When end users run the **root** template, shared assets from `common/` will still be injected on top of what the new template supplies.

If you later update shared chatmodes and want the new template’s snapshot refreshed, re-run the scaffold (it will not overwrite existing files unless you remove them first) or manually copy changes (the scaffold copies, it does not symlink).

Note: `--trust` is required because the internal scaffold uses Copier tasks to create folders and copy chatmode files; without it, tasks are blocked.

> Tip: Each template may include its own `.github` and `.vscode` folders to override or extend the common assets.

### Update existing templates with latest common assets (maintainer utilities)

When you change shared assets under `common/` (chatmodes, instructions, prompts, or any files under `.vscode/`) you can refresh the snapshot inside one or all template directories using internal Copier utilities (no standalone script required).

Update a single template:

```zsh
copier copy --trust internal/update-template .
```

Prompts:

- `target_template` (e.g. `gist`, `sst`, `typescript`)
- Toggle asset groups: chatmodes, instructions, prompts, mcp
- Overwrite mode: `overwrite` (default) vs `skip`

Update all templates (requires explicit confirmation):

```zsh
copier copy --trust internal/update-all-templates .
```

Prompts:

- `templates_list`: space separated names (default: `gha gist prompteng sst typescript`)
- Same toggles for asset groups & overwrite mode
- `confirm_all` must be true or the run aborts (safety guard)

Behavior:

- Uses `rsync` to merge common assets into template directories.
- Excludes `README.md` files from common (same as root generation behavior).

These utilities keep template directories in sync for inspection or cloning; end users always receive the latest shared assets at generation via the root `copier.yml`.

## Prerequisites

- Homebrew (macOS)
- Copier (via Homebrew)

```zsh
# Install Homebrew if you need it: https://brew.sh
brew update
brew install copier
```

## Apply to an existing project with Copier

This repository is meant to be applied to an existing project (not to start a new one). Run Copier from your existing project root and use `.` as the destination.

### Preview (dry run)

```zsh
# From your existing project root
copier copy --pretend "gh:chandima/copilot-sdd-templates" .
```
What happens:
- If you have NOT applied this template before (no `.copier-answers.yml` yet), Copier will prompt you for `template_name`.
- If a previous run stored an answer, it will reuse it silently (so you might NOT see a prompt).

Available template names (directory names under `templates/`):
- beastmode
- gha
- gist
- plan
- prompting
- sst
- typescript

Non-interactive (explicit template, reproducible & CI‑friendly):

```zsh
copier copy --pretend --data template_name=sst "gh:chandima/copilot-sdd-templates" .
```

Need to force a new prompt? Delete or edit `.copier-answers.yml` first, then rerun the dry run without `--data`.

### Apply changes

Run non-interactively by specifying the template explicitly (recommended for reproducibility):

```zsh
copier copy --data template_name=sst "gh:chandima/copilot-sdd-templates" .
```

If you omit `--data template_name=...` and no existing `.copier-answers.yml` contains a value, Copier will prompt you for `template_name`.

What happens:

- Copier writes a `.copier-answers.yml` in your project to record choices.
- Common assets and the chosen template’s files are merged into your repo.
- Existing files are respected per template rules (e.g., `skip_if_exists`), and common `README.md` files are not copied.
- Commit your repo before applying, then review the diff after.

## How common assets are applied

- During generation, common assets from `common/.github/*` and `common/.vscode/*` are copied into the output project.
- `README.md` files inside `common/` are intentionally NOT copied (to avoid overwriting your project README).
- Template-specific files take precedence if they define the same paths.

Tip: After the first apply, you can bring in updates later using `copier update` from your project root.

## Updating shared content

- Edit files under `common/.github/*` or `common/.vscode/*`.
- From your project root, run `copier update` to pull in changes while respecting your local edits.
- Because template-specific files can override common files, review diffs when updating.

Advanced:

- If you need to re-apply the template ignoring project history (not usually recommended), use `copier recopy` and resolve any conflicts, then commit.

## Troubleshooting

- If Copier doesn't prompt for `template_name`, ensure you're pointing at this repo (the template source) and running from your project root with `.` as destination.
- If your Copier version doesn't support certain features, upgrade:

```zsh
brew upgrade copier
```

- If common assets don't appear, check the root `copier.yml` in this repo and your Copier version, then re-run the apply or update.

## Notes

- Commands above are written for macOS zsh.
- MCP-related configurations live under `.vscode/mcp` (alongside any other shared VS Code settings) and `.github/chatmodes`/`prompts`/`instructions`.
